## <u>Setting up NuGet Package Manager</u>
From the toolbar, Open Tools &rarr; Nuget Package Manager &rarr; Package Manager Settings.
1. Click **Clear All NuGet Storage** in the General tab.
2. Click on **Package Sources** under the NuGet Package Manager tab on the Options window.
3. Ensure the **nuget.org** package source is set up correctly, with the Source set to the following (URL)[https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json].
If any changes were made, make sure to click the **Update** button to save changes,
4. Add a new package source:
    - Set the name to **Microsoft Labs Community Toolkit**
    - Set the Source to the following (URL)[https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dotnet/CommunityToolkit/_packaging/CommunityToolkit-Labs/nuget/v3/index.json]
    - Click **Update** to save changes.
5. Click **Ok** on the Options window and close

## <u>Running the App</u>
1. Clone the project from the following GitHub [link](https://github.com/guardsense/EG_Source).
2. Open **Core.sln** inside the Core folder from the root directory. 
3. Visual Studio will automatically detect the Energy Performance startup project. Ensure that "EnergyPerformance" is selected at the top bar of Visual Studio, under the startup project dropdown, rather than "Core" or "EnergyPerformance.Tests.MSTest".
4. Either click one of the two *Run* buttons at the top bar of Visual Studio, next to *Energy Performance (Package)* **OR** on the toolbar, under Debug, press either *Start Debugging* or *Start Without Debugging*.
5. Building the project for the first time may take a while, as Visual Studio will download and install all NuGet packages required for the application. On future runs, deployment will be much faster.
6. After the project is built, the app will start. To exit the app, either press the *Stop* button in Visual Studio (if started with debugging) or right click on the new icon in the taskbar tray for EnergyGuard, and press **Exit**.

## <u>Deploying the App for Publishing</u>
1. Open the *Solution Explorer* window in Visual Studio.
2. Right click on the **Energy Performance** project and select Package and Publish &rarr; Create App Package.
3. To distribute the app to the Microsoft Store, select *Microsoft Store under a new app name* and follow the instructions displayed.
4. For standard distribution to all other sources, select *Sideloading* and click next:
    1. Select *Yes, select a certificate* and either:
        - Select a package signing certificate from a trusted source if you already have one available.
        - Select *Create* to create a new **self-signed test certificate** for testing deployment. Enter a publisher name and password and click 'OK'. Select **Trust** on the newly created certificate to trust this certificate on your system.
    2. Click Next &rarr; Next &rarr; Create, using the default installation settings already selected.
    3. Once Visual Studio has finished creating the package, a new window will open showing the *Output location* of the newly created package. Open this folder and navigate to the new EnergyPerformance directory with the latest version name.
    4. Open the .msix file in this file and click **Install** to install the distributed version of the app on your device.
    5. You can now find the app installed on your system through the Start Menu.

## <u>Generating Documentation</u>

To generate documentation using docfx:

1. Install docfx as a global tool using the command:

   ​	`dotnet tool update -g docfx`

2. Comment out `using CLI;` in both `CpuInfo.cs` and `CpuTrackerService.cs`

3. Uncomment `using EnergyPerformance.Temporary;` in **both** these files.

4. Comment out `<ProjectReference Include="..\Wrapper\Wrapper.vcxproj" />` in `EnergyPerformance.csproj`.
    This will remove the reference to the Wrapper project which contains the C++/CLI code, as docfx does not support these
    files.

5. Run the following command in a new terminal inside the `docs` folder:

   ​	`docfx docfx.json --serve`

   This will build the documentation and deploy the website to http://localhost:8080/.

5. After viewing the website, press `Ctrl + C` or close the terminal, to stop hosting the website.
6.  **Undo all the changes** specified in instructions 2-4. Feel free to use Git to discard these changes to speed up this process.
